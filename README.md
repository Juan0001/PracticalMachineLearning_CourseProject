### Personal Activity Prediction 1.Rmd

A R Markdown file containing the report of how to predict the correct human activity. To run it, the knitr package need to be installed and the data set for analysis (pml-training.csv and pml-train.csv) need to be downloaded in the same directory of the Rmd file. After you install the knitr package, open the file in RStudio and press the "Knit HTML" button to generate the report.
